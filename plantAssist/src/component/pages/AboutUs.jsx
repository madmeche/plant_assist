            During COVID lockdown of 2020, it was very common for people to develop a hobby.
            Madeleine was post Mardi Gras accident and recovery from the consequential surgery.
            This lead to lots of time spent outdoors enjoying her back patio. 
            Little did she know, her back patio was lacking lucious greenery and pots overflowing with 
            flowering goodness. Now working from home, with ample time on her hands, she decided it 
            was time to change that.

            But getting started was harder than she realized.
            Plants were more finicky than she realized, and she was dedicated to make keeping her
            new sanctuary alive.
